While many websites do already exist in the self-help and habit-building space, many do not apply principles of behavioral interventions to increase the effectiveness and likelihood that those behaviors will become habits or that the user will achieve whatever goals they have set for themselves. As such, my senior project was to design and implement a website that allows users to choose certain behaviors, set goals for themselves, and then track their behavior over time. Built into the web application are several different functionalities that look at the antecedents of the behavior as well as the consequences. Overall, the principles of behavioral change therapy focused around peer involvement, setting events, feedback and reinforcement.
